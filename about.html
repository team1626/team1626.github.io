                <h1>We are Team 1626</h1>
                <p>Starting as a team of only 10 members and 2 mentors in September, 2005, 1626 has flourished into a companionship of 45 members, 1 teacher moderator, 2 engineering mentors, and 4 business mentors. We believe that the most important aspect of instilling a love for STEM is early and recurrent exposure to the wonders of both FIRST Robotics and a career in STEM.  As a result, we take pride in our mentoring program and recognize it to be a major key of our club activities.  We have set up numerous events throughout the year to teach kids both inside and out of school so that they may find their way into the STEM field. 1626 seeks to exemplify this attitude through its inclusion in over 3 pre-season events and business sponsorships as we continue to grow as a team.</p>

                <h1>FLL Event</h1>
                <p>Team 1626 hosts a yearly FLL event, this year having over 40 FLL teams, the greatest amount we have seen since we started hosting. Often, this is a student's first time at any sort of Robotics event, and mentors utilize this competition to train rookies.</p>

                <h1>Scouting App</h1>
                <p>A free open source app for both iOS and Andriod that streamlines the scouting process. The app utilizes modern day programming languages to enable robotics teams to scout better.</p>

                <h1>Bike Drive</h1>
                <p>1626 spreads its wings of dynamic influence beyond the robot build. Our annual Bike Drive collects old bikes which are later rehabilitated to good and operational health. Thus, low-income families who do not necessaily have the funds to purchase new bikes can buy these second-hand ones that function just as well.</p>

                <p>FIRST works to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. A form of FIRST competition, First Robotics Competiton is a friendly competition that combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology in order to culminate with district and regional events where qualifying teams compete for awards and a spot at the FIRST Championship.</p>
